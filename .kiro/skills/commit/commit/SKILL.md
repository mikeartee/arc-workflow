description: Plan and create git commits autonomously for changes made in this session (no per-commit approval prompt). Cross-session dirty files — files modified outside this conversation's tool calls — get confirmed before inclusion. Explicit file lists only, never `git add -A`. No Claude attribution lines. Use when user wants to commit, says "/commit", or asks to land changes.

# Commit Changes

Fully autonomous for changes made in this session. The user invoked `/commit` — *that* is the approval. Don't pause to ask "Shall I proceed?"

The only legitimate reason to stop and ask is **cross-session ambiguity**: dirty files in the tree that this conversation didn't produce.

## Process

1. **Classify the dirty tree.**
   - Run `git status` to list every dirty and untracked file.
   - For each, decide which bucket it falls into:
     - **Session changes** — files this conversation modified via `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, or files you created/modified through `Bash` commands you ran. You have the full conversation history; you know what you touched.
     - **Other-origin changes** — files that were already dirty when the session started, or modified by something outside your tool calls (the user editing in another window, a build process, a pre-commit hook, a sibling agent).
   - When in doubt, classify as other-origin — better to confirm than to over-include.

2. **Confirm the other-origin bucket (only if non-empty).**
   - Show the list, one line per file: `<path> — <one-line note on what kind of change, if known>`.
   - Ask once: *"These files are dirty but I didn't touch them this session. Include in the commit, leave them out, or stage them as a separate commit?"*
   - Default to "leave them out" if the user is uncertain — they can always re-run `/commit` after staging by hand.
   - If the bucket is empty, skip this step entirely.

3. **Plan the commit(s).**
   - Group session changes into **one logical commit by default**. Always include all the session's code changes — don't ask which subset to land. Split into multiple commits only when the diff genuinely covers two unrelated concerns (e.g. a feature change plus a doc typo that crept in).
   - Draft a clear, imperative commit message focused on *why*, not what. Multi-line if there's substance worth recording; one line for a small change. Match the repo's existing commit-message style (check `git log --oneline -n 20` if unsure).

4. **Execute.**
   - `git add <file1> <file2> …` — explicit paths only. **Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or any wildcard form** that could sweep in untracked files you didn't intend.
   - `git commit -m "<message>"` — use a heredoc for multi-line messages.
   - `git log --oneline -n <count>` to verify.

5. **Report.** One short line per commit: sha + subject. Done.

## Safety rails (override autonomy)

These checks fire automatically and **do not** count as "confirmation prompts" — they protect the commit, they don't ask permission:

- **Refuse to stage** `.env*`, `*credentials*`, `*secret*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, files matching any pattern in `.gitignore` that somehow got dirty, and large binaries (>10 MB). Surface them in the final report as "skipped for safety" with a one-line reason each.
- **Pre-commit hook failure** — fix the underlying issue and create a **new** commit. Never use `--no-verify`; never `git commit --amend` after a failed hook (the previous commit may not have been created at all, so amend would modify the wrong target).
- **Pre-existing commit on main/master** — if the current branch is `main` and the repo's ship style is PR (per `docs/agents/ship-style.md`), refuse to commit directly and surface the mistake. The user should be on a feature branch.

## Important

- **No co-author lines, no Claude attribution.** Commits should read as if the user wrote them. No `Co-Authored-By:`, no "🤖 Generated with…", no trailer of any kind beyond what the repo's own commit convention requires.
- **No `git add -A`.** Ever. Explicit file lists are how we prevent unrelated dirt from sneaking into a commit.
- **Autonomous means autonomous.** Don't draft a plan and ask "Shall I proceed?" — just execute. The user already said yes when they typed `/commit`.

## Why this shape

- **Autonomous for session changes** because `/commit` is invoked after work the user already knows about. Re-confirming each commit was friction without value.
- **Confirm for other-origin changes** because the conversation history can't account for them — they're a genuine signal of ambiguity, the one case where stopping is the right call.
- **Never `-A`** because the cost of a bad surprise (committing `.env` or a stash file) is far higher than the cost of typing a few paths.
