name: verify-coverage
description: Verify every PRD user story is covered by a passing, non-vacuous behavioral test — Tier A maps to an existing test; Tier B generates one, mutation-proves it, and runs it. Auto-files gaps as new sub-issues and writes a coverage receipt. Used as `/tdd-parallel`'s step-4b subroutine in `--auto` mode (the common path), or invoked directly against any PRD whose slices have shipped.

# Verify Coverage

`/to-issues` slices a PRD into issues and `/tdd` builds them, but the
only post-implementation completeness signal is *structural*: the tracker
auto-closes the parent when every child closes. "All slices shipped" is
not "all user stories covered" — those come apart exactly when slicing
drops or misframes a story.

This skill closes that loop. It uses the PRD's `## User Stories` section
as an **acceptance oracle** (not as implementation context — `/tdd`
deliberately never sees it) and answers, per story, *is there a passing
behavioral test that proves this is built?* It does **not** trust
prose-vs-prose or code-search judgement — a story is covered only when an
executable, non-vacuous test says so.

It is also the **termination oracle** for `/tdd-parallel`'s auto-loop:
the loop iterates fanout → integration review → verify-coverage until
this skill returns zero gaps (or a circuit breaker fires). Without it,
`/tdd-parallel` has no semantic completeness signal — only the
structural "all slices merged" one, which is exactly the signal that's
insufficient.

## Role in the pipeline

This is a verification primitive, almost always chained by an
orchestrator (`/tdd-parallel` step 4b, in `--auto` mode). Direct user
invocation is supported for two cases:

- Auditing a PRD whose slices shipped via a different path (hotfix
  merged by hand, legacy work).
- Re-verifying after a manual edit of the integrated branch.

Three human gates that earlier versions of this skill held — story
classification, HITL human-attestation, and a matrix-confirmation
review — have all moved upstream:

- **Classification** moved to `/to-prd`: every story carries
  `acceptance: automatable` + `observable: <description>` sub-bullets
  written at PRD-authoring time. This skill reads them instead of
  judging.
- **HITL human-attestation** is gone. Non-automatable stories
  (visual/UX, "feels welcoming", real external systems) are refused at
  `/to-prd` time — they don't enter this pipeline.
- **Matrix confirmation** is gone in `--auto` mode. Auto-filed gap
  issues land as `ready-for-agent` so `/tdd-parallel` can fanout the
  remediation directly; the human review surface moves to `/triage`
  (which is where false-positive gaps get caught, no different from any
  other triage-able backlog item).

What remains is the load-bearing core: Tier A finds an existing passing
test; Tier B generates one, mutation-proves it non-vacuous, runs it;
gaps get filed and quarantined; a receipt is written.

## Usage

```
/zsl:verify-coverage <parent-prd-issue>           # default mode
/zsl:verify-coverage <parent-prd-issue> --auto    # for orchestrator chaining
/zsl:verify-coverage                              # no arg → picker of tracking PRDs
```

Flags:

- `--auto` — orchestrator mode. Skips the matrix-confirmation step (no
  user prompt before filing), files gap issues as `ready-for-agent`
  directly (no `needs-triage` hop), and emits a structured terminal
  block the orchestrator parses. Use this when `/tdd-parallel` chains
  the skill; direct user invocations should usually omit it.
- `--no-file` — produce the matrix and quarantined failing tests, but
  do **not** auto-file gap issues. Report-only. Still a full run —
  writes a gate-satisfying receipt (verification happened; you chose
  not to file).
- `--no-generate` — Tier A only. Stories without an existing passing
  test are reported as `unverified` rather than driven through Tier B.
  Fast pass for a quick read; no tests are written. Writes a **partial**
  receipt; **does not satisfy `/tdd-parallel`'s auto-loop termination**
  — unverified rows mean those stories weren't actually checked.

## Pre-flight

Refuse with a clear message if any fails:

- `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` exists (run `/setup-zsl-superpowers`
  if not). `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` exists.
- The input resolves to a PRD: an issue with a `## User Stories`
  section. No argument → present a numbered picker of issues in the
  `tracking` state. If the resolved issue has no `## User Stories`
  section it is not a PRD — refuse and say so.
- **Every user story has both `acceptance: automatable` and
  `observable: <description>` sub-bullets.** Any story tagged anything
  other than `automatable` (e.g. `manual-attestation`) is invalid —
  that lane has been removed; the PRD must be reworked in `/to-prd` or
  split. Any story missing either sub-bullet is invalid. Refuse with
  the offending story numbers and a pointer to `/to-prd`'s tag format.
- The working tree is on the branch carrying the integrated work (the
  PRD/integration branch for a `/tdd-parallel` run, or wherever the
  shipped slices live). Refuse if dirty (`git status --porcelain`
  non-empty) — Tier B writes and runs tests, and a dirty tree makes
  the non-vacuity mutation unsafe to revert cleanly.

Use the project domain glossary so story vocabulary maps onto the
codebase's and test suite's vocabulary; respect ADRs in the touched
area. See `engineering/tdd/tests.md` for what a behavioural test is and
`engineering/tdd/mocking.md` for what disqualifies one.

## Process

### 1. Build the story inventory

Parse the PRD's `## User Stories` into a numbered list, verbatim. For
each story, capture its `observable:` sub-bullet — Tier B uses it as
the test-generation hint. Parse `## Out of Scope`: any story (or
behaviour) that `## Out of Scope` excludes is marked `out-of-scope` now
and never verified — record the PRD line that excludes it as the
evidence.

The pre-flight already validated that every story carries
`acceptance: automatable` and an `observable:` line, so there is no
classification step at runtime — every in-scope story goes through
Tier A then Tier B.

### 2. Build the story → slice map

Fetch the PRD's sub-issues per `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. For each
**shipped** (closed/done) slice, read its `## User stories covered`
section — the mapping `/to-issues` persists into each issue body.
Invert it into `story → [slices]`.

- A slice whose section says `None — enabling/infrastructure slice`
  contributes no story coverage; that is expected, not a gap.
- Slices created before `/to-issues` persisted this section won't have
  it. Fall back to inferring the map from each slice's `## What to
  build` + its merged diff, and **warn** that the map is inferred and
  lower-confidence for those slices.
- A story with no claiming slice is a strong gap candidate — but
  absence of a claim is not proof of absence, and presence of a claim
  is not proof of coverage. Every story is still verified by test
  below regardless of what the map says; the map only decides Tier A
  search order and surfaces suspicious holes early.

### 3. Tier A — map to an existing passing test

For each in-scope story, search the test suite for the behavioural
test(s) that exercise it (the story → slice map narrows where to look;
the glossary aligns naming; the `observable:` line names the
behaviour). A story is **covered** only when:

- a mapped test **passes** when run now, **and**
- reading the test body confirms it exercises *this story's*
  behaviour through a public interface — not a name coincidence, not
  an implementation-detail assertion (`tests.md` rules apply).

Run the mapped tests (scope to the relevant suite/files; a full run
is fine if cheap). Record the passing test's path + name as the
evidence. Anything not satisfied here falls through to Tier B.

### 4. Tier B — generate, prove non-vacuous, run

Skip this step entirely under `--no-generate` (such stories →
`unverified`).

For each story Tier A did not satisfy:

1. **Write one acceptance test** expressing the story's observable
   behaviour through the public interface. The `observable:` line
   from the PRD is the contract — turn it into an assertion against
   the public interface. Behaviour, not implementation — it must read
   like the story (`tdd/SKILL.md` philosophy).
2. **Prove it is non-vacuous by mutation.** A test that passes
   against broken code proves nothing. Perturb the implementing code
   path (force a wrong return / comment out the effect), run the
   test, and confirm it goes **RED**. Then revert the perturbation
   exactly (the pre-flight clean-tree check makes this safe). A test
   that stays GREEN under perturbation is vacuous — discard it and
   re-derive against a different observable (re-read the
   `observable:` line — it should pin the behaviour precisely).
3. **Run it against the real integrated code:**
   - GREEN + proven non-vacuous → story **covered**. The generated
     test is a durable regression artifact — keep it.
   - RED → genuine **gap**. Keep the failing test as the receipt; it
     is dispositioned in step 7.

Generate one test, prove it, run it, move on — never batch-write
Tier B tests (same anti-horizontal-slicing reason as `tdd/SKILL.md`).

### 5. Coverage matrix

Render one row per story:

| State | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `covered` | Tier A or Tier B GREEN | test path+name |
| `gap` | Tier B RED | failing test path |
| `unverified` | `--no-generate`, no existing test | — |
| `out-of-scope` | excluded by PRD `## Out of Scope` | the excluding PRD line |

Print aggregate counts.

**Default mode (no `--auto`)**: before filing anything, **confirm with
the user** — this matrix is a review surface. The user can override any
row (e.g. accept a gap as out-of-scope, or reclassify).

**`--auto` mode**: skip the confirmation; proceed directly to step 6.
The human review surface moves downstream to `/triage` (for filed gap
issues) — if Tier B misjudged an observable and filed a bogus gap, the
triage step is where it's caught and dropped.

### 6. Disposition the failing Tier B tests

A red test cannot land on a green suite. For each `gap` with a failing
test, quarantine it with the project's skip/xfail marker (infer from
the test framework — `@pytest.mark.skip`, `it.skip`, `t.Skip`,
`xit`, …), and put the gap issue reference in the skip reason:

```
skip("gap: PRD story <N> — see <issue-ref>; un-skip when implemented")
```

Commit the quarantined tests via `/commit` (never craft commits
yourself). This makes every gap traceable from the suite itself, and
the remediation slice's acceptance criterion becomes literally
"un-skip this test and make it green." Under `--no-file` there is no
issue ref yet — use `gap: PRD story <N> — unfiled` and tell the user.

### 7. Auto-file the gaps

Skip under `--no-file`. For each `gap` (Tier B RED), publish one issue
per `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`:

- **Title:** `Cover PRD story <N>: <short description>`. Do **not**
  pre-assign an `[AFK]`/wave-number prefix — these are un-sliced work
  items, not slices. If the auto-loop later re-sliced them, that
  prefix would conflict.
- **Body** (issue template below).
- **Labels:**
  - **Default mode**: `needs-triage` + `backlog` (same convention
    `/to-issues` uses) so each enters normal triage.
  - **`--auto` mode**: `ready-for-agent` + `backlog`. The acceptance
    criterion is fully specified (the quarantined test is the
    contract), the work is definitionally AFK (manual stories were
    refused at PRD ingestion), and the orchestrator is about to
    fanout these issues in its next loop iteration — going through
    `/triage` first would just stall the loop. Quality risk (a
    false-positive gap getting auto-fixed) is bounded: the
    remediation slice will write code to make the (potentially
    wrong) test green; a subsequent verify-coverage round will either
    declare the story covered or surface the inconsistency. The
    circuit breakers in `/tdd-parallel` cap the worst case.
- **Link as a sub-issue of the PRD** using the same mechanism
  `/to-issues` uses, so the PRD stays the tracking container and does
  not spuriously auto-close while gaps are open:

  ```bash
  PARENT_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"OWNER",name:"REPO"){issue(number:PARENT){id}}}' -q .data.repository.issue.id)
  CHILD_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"OWNER",name:"REPO"){issue(number:CHILD){id}}}' -q .data.repository.issue.id)
  gh api graphql -f query='mutation($p:ID!,$c:ID!){addSubIssue(input:{issueId:$p,subIssueId:$c}){subIssue{number}}}' -f p="$PARENT_ID" -f c="$CHILD_ID"
  ```

  Linear: set `parentId`. GitLab / local-markdown / unsupported: the
  `## Parent` text reference is the only link.

<issue-template>
## Parent

A reference to the PRD issue on the issue tracker.

## What to build

The PRD user story this gap leaves uncovered, quoted verbatim
(including its `acceptance:` and `observable:` sub-bullets), plus a
one-line statement of the observed gap (Tier B test RED against the
integrated branch).

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The quarantined test `<path::name>` is un-skipped and passes
- [ ] Behaviour is reachable through the public interface, not an
  implementation-detail assertion

## Blocked by

None - can start immediately
</issue-template>

If `docs/agents/project-board.md` exists, newly filed issues are
auto-added to the project by the user's existing workflow; do not
move the PRD's own card (it remains a tracking container).

### 8. Post the coverage receipt

This is the artifact `/tdd-parallel`'s auto-loop consumes — write it
on **every** completed run (including `--no-file` and `--no-generate`),
after the matrix is computed and any filing/disposition is done.

Capture `git rev-parse HEAD` as the **verified-sha** — the receipt
asserts "coverage was checked against *this* tree." Write the receipt
per `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` conventions:

- **GitHub / GitLab:** post a comment on the PRD issue, led by the
  literal marker line `## Coverage receipt — verify-coverage` so the
  orchestrator can find the latest one.
- **Local markdown:** write/overwrite
  `.scratch/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/verify-coverage-receipt.md` and
  include it in the same commit as the quarantined tests.

Receipt body (stable fields the orchestrator parses):

```
## Coverage receipt — verify-coverage
- prd: <PRD ref>
- branch: <branch name>
- verified-sha: <full git sha>
- mode: full | partial (--no-generate)
- invocation: auto | manual
- matrix: covered=<n> gap=<n> unverified=<n> out-of-scope=<n>
- gaps-filed: <#a, #b | none (--no-file) | none (no gaps)>
- ts: <ISO-8601 UTC>
```

`mode: partial` (a `--no-generate` run) is recorded honestly and will
**not** terminate `/tdd-parallel`'s auto-loop — the orchestrator wants
every story actually exercised, not skipped as `unverified`.
`invocation` records whether this run was chained by an orchestrator
(`auto`) or invoked directly by a human (`manual`) — useful for audit
("when did this story start failing?").

### 9. Terminal report

Print the structured terminal block the orchestrator parses:

```
verify-coverage: matrix covered=<n> gap=<n> unverified=<n> out-of-scope=<n>
gaps-filed: <#a, #b | none>
quarantined-tests-commit: <sha | none>
receipt: <comment URL or file path>
verified-sha: <full git sha>
```

Plus, for direct invocation (no `--auto`), a one-line next-step hint:

> Filed N gap issues as sub-issues of #PRD. Run `/triage` to walk them
> to `ready-for-agent`, then `/tdd-parallel <PRD>` to clear them — the
> remediation slices un-skip the quarantined tests.

Under `--auto`, omit the hint — the orchestrator is the next step.

Do not chain — this skill ends here.

## Not in scope

- Implementing the gaps — that's `/tdd` / `/tdd-parallel`.
- Triaging or slicing the filed gap issues — that's `/triage` /
  `/to-issues`. (In `--auto` mode, the orchestrator fanouts them
  directly without a triage hop because the gap is fully specified by
  its quarantined test.)
- Verifying anything against a PRD that has no `## User Stories`
  section, or whose stories aren't 100% `automatable` — refuse in
  pre-flight.

## Constraints

- **Test, don't assess.** No story reaches `covered` on prose or
  code-search judgement alone — only a passing, non-vacuous
  behavioural test (Tier A/B).
- **Every Tier B test must survive the mutation check** before its
  result is trusted. Vacuous tests are worse than no test.
- **The matrix outcome is advisory in default mode, automatic in
  `--auto`.** In default mode, ends in user confirmation. In `--auto`,
  the human review surface moves to `/triage` (for filed gaps);
  `/tdd-parallel`'s circuit breakers (round limit, per-story retry
  limit, no-progress halt) cap the worst case of a misjudged
  observable looping.
